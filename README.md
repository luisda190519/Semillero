# AI-Powered Body Metrics Estimation

## Overview

This project focuses on using pre-trained artificial intelligence models to accurately estimate a person's weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) from nine body images (three frontal, three lateral, and three rear views). By leveraging image processing techniques and deep learning, we aim to improve health assessment and body parameter measurement.

## Features

- Estimation of weight, height, and BMI from body images
- Use of pre-trained AI models
- Image preprocessing for improved accuracy
- Option for manual height input for more precise weight estimation
- Analysis of body silhouettes and skeletal joint estimation

## Problem Statement

The research addresses the challenge of estimating crucial health attributes (weight and height) using body images obtained in uncontrolled environments. These images are characterized by various factors, including variations in subject posture, lighting conditions, and the presence of undesirable artifacts.

## Objectives

1. Evaluate and select suitable pre-trained machine learning models for biometric attribute estimation.
2. Develop image preprocessing techniques to address variability in capture conditions and artifacts.
3. Refine and adjust pre-trained models for more accurate weight, height, and BMI estimations.
4. Validate the performance of optimized models through extensive testing.
5. Assess the research's impact on promoting healthy eating habits and preventive healthcare.

## Methodology

1. Data collection and model selection
2. Algorithm creation and optimization
3. Image preprocessing (resolution adjustment and cropping)
4. Silhouette analysis and skeletal joint estimation
5. Optional manual height input for improved weight estimation
6. Data organization and systematic analysis
7. Result validation and comparison with state-of-the-art methods

## Results

- Successfully optimized pre-trained machine learning models for accurate weight and height estimation.
- Achieved high precision in estimating weight and height from body images.
- Implemented a manual height input option for more accurate weight estimation.
- Conducted extensive testing on diverse datasets with solid and consistent results.

## Impact

This research advances the field of biometric attribute estimation from body images in uncontrolled environments. It contributes to health and nutrition by providing a non-invasive and accurate tool for estimating a person's weight and height, promoting healthy eating habits and body weight management.

## Future Work

- Integration with food recognition and nutritional content estimation
- Further optimization of models for various body types and conditions
- Development of a user-friendly application combining body metrics and nutritional analysis
